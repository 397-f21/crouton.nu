Moreover, as data and computing increasingly mediate modern life, knowing a bit about the mechanisms (and risks) that underlie these systems is a valuable modern literacy that is likely to serve you well.</p>\r\n<p>The intent of the course is twofold. <br/>First, we want you to gain a sense of the many different kinds of problem-solving and creative pursuits that programming can support.  Programming can act as a representational medium, a tool for thinking about problems, a way of amplifying and/or communicating ideas, a means of performing complex calculations over massive datasets, and much more. </p>\r\n<p>Second, we want you learn fundamental constructs of computer programming along with skills and strategies to apply them in creative and useful ways. Towards this end, there will be quite a few practice problems to get you familiar with ‘the basics,’ as well as longer, open-ended programming projects that encourage you to marshal these ideas towards your own creative applications. These applications may include authoring electronic dance music, animations, games, and/or simple apps that interact with data and media from various sources (e.g. Yelp, Spotify, Twitter, various databases, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have some experience writing programs, working with the command line, working with different kinds of data, and participating in several important programming practices (e.g. debugging, testing, and designing programs; reading technical documentation and sample code; installing and exploring third-party modules and APIs). Our hope is that this course will help you to see how your goals and knowledge might be supported via computing, while helping you to develop the proficiency and confidence needed to actualize these goals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PREREQUISITES: </strong>None. <span>We assume <em>no</em> knowledge of programming or computing.</span></p>"

First, you will learn about the hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern computer system. This will provide a conceptual framework that you can then flesh out with courses such as compilers, operating systems, databases, networks, security, real-time systems, and others. The second purpose is to demystify the machine and the tools that we use to program it. This includes telling you the little details that students usually have to learn by osmosis. In combination, these two purposes will give you the background to understand many different computer systems. The third purpose is to bring you up to speed in doing systems programming in a low-level language (C) in the Unix (Linux/GCC/GDB/etc) environment. The final purpose is to prepare you for upper-level courses in systems.</p>\r\n<p>This is a learn-by-doing kind of class.

            "Description": "<p>Story games (or storygames) are narrative frameworks in which participants (players) collaborate with each other and with the system to tell stories they find compelling.  Examples include story-centric computer role-playing games such as <em>Disco Elysium</em>, but also larp and story-centric tabletop role playing games such as those based on the Fate, PBtA, GUMSHOE, and DramaSystem systems, as well as smaller, more personal games of the lyric games movement.</p>\r\n<p>In this course we will study, play and design story games, study and build AI-based story-generation systems, and experiment with the use of AI systems in story games.  No previous programming knowledge is necessary for the 295 section.  The 396 section will go more deeply into the formal and algorithmic foundations of these technologies.</p>\r\n<p>AI assignments will use two experimental AI systems, <em>Step</em>, and <em>Imaginarium</em>, designed to be accessible to non-programmers.  295 students will use these systems as tools to make stories and story artifacts.  396 students will additionally learn their detailed semantics and structure. </p>\r\n<h3>Grading</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Individual assignments: 50% (AI assignments, weekly feedback from your group)</li>\r\n<li>Group assignments: 50% (game designs, weekly gameplay reports)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Reasons not to take this course</h3>\r\n<p>This class is not for everyone.  One issue is that we really will play story games in class.  These games involve acting, and effectively, fiction writing.  If these things will make you feel exposed and uncomfortable, that’s okay, but you might not enjoy the course.  That said, you will never be graded on your acting ability or artistry, only on whether you showed up prepared for your games and you made an honest effort.</p>\r\n<p>This is not intended to be a conceptually difficult course.  But it will be a time-intensive course, since it will involve not only programming, but playing games, reading games, and watching videos of games being played.  Students should expect to spend 10 hours a week on outside activities (gameplay, assigned readings and videos, game design, and working with the AI tools, guest speakers).</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we will be playing improvisational games that emphasize character and story, not combat-oriented RPGs like <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> that make less contact with the AI and narrative issues we want to explore.  So if you’re drawn to RPGs for combat, leveling up, min-maxing, etc., you may be disappointed by the course.</p>\r\n<h3>Thematic content and trigger warnings</h3>\r\n<p>These games tell stories; they’re a form of literature or theatre.  As such, they address the same wide range of themes as traditional literature and theatre.  While we will avoid playing games likely to produce emotional distress, we will discuss a wide range of games.  Some of these games may address difficult issues such as race, gender, ethnic conflict, poverty, anti-capitalism, religion, sexuality, disability, illness, mortality, suicide, and mental health.</p>\r\n<p>Many games involve explicit depictions or simulations of violence.  Although, we will not play games that mandate graphic depictions of violence, many of the games we discuss will have some notion of combat.  Some games seek to raise awareness of intimate partner violence, child abuse, or sexual assault, although we will not play them.</p>\r\n<p>Horror has been an especially important genre in the historical development of narrative games.  These include games involving threats from monsters, but also cosmic/existential horror.  As with any horror literature, they can also involve themes or events deliberately chosen for their disturbing nature: serial killing, war crimes, child abuse, etc.  These games also often represent mental illness, usually in ways chosen for dramatic effect more than clinical accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, contemporary game design is often critically and politically engaged.  At least three different games we will mention touch on the issues of access to health care within the US.  One of the collections we will discuss is named <a href=\"http://storytelling.pelgranepress.com/feminism-a-nano-game-anthology/\"><em>#feminism</em></a>.  Some of the games we will discuss are designed by members LGBTQIA+ community and engage issues of queer experience, be it contemporary, historical or fantastical.</p>\r\n<p>Again, we will not play games in class that are likely to produce emotional distress.  In the event of unanticipated emotional distress, any student may bow out of any game at any time.  That said, if any of the content discussed above is problematic for you, you might prefer to avoid the course.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE COORDINATOR: <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/horswill-ian.html\" target=\"_self\">Prof. Ian Horswil</a><br/>COURSE INSTRUCTOR: <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/horswill-ian.html\" target=\"_self\">Prof. Ian Horswil</a></strong></p>"

Students participate in DTR through fast-paced, quarter-long programs (intended to be repeated). Students work with a mentor to identify a direction of research, explore and iterate over designs, prototype at varying fidelities, build working systems, conduct evaluative studies, and report findings through conference publications. As a cohort, each week students demo their prototypes, provide and receive feedback, and help each other resolve technical challenges. DTR adapts and extends agile development and design-based research practices with scrums, sprints, studio critique, design logs, and pair research. <strong><a href=\"http://dtr.northwestern.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">View course website</a></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>This course satisfies the project requirement, Interfaces Breadth requirement.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE INSTRUCTOR: </strong><a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/zhang-haoqi.html\">Prof. Haoqi Zhang</a> (Fall & Winter), <a href=\"mailto:yk@u.northwestern.edu\">Prof. Kim</a> (Spring)</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>COURSE OBJECTIVES:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Below is a rough schedule for the course. Students meet with the instructor weeks prior to signing up for the course to determine a research direction.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Weeks 1 & 2: Learn relevant web, mobile, and wearable technologies.</li>\r\n<li>Weeks 1 to 5: Rapidly prototype at increasingly higher fidelities and go through numerous design iterations based on frequent user feedback and in-lab testing.</li>\r\n<li>Weeks 6 to 8: Setting up and conducting user studies to test key hypotheses.</li>\r\n<li>Weeks 8 to 10: Analyze collected data and report on their findings. Write academic papers for submission to leading publications as well as blog articles for the general audience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span>PROJECTS:</span></strong> Undergraduates participate in DTR for one or more quarters. Each quarter is a well-scoped, self-contained research project that culminates in a working prototype, a user study or deployment, and an academic paper. The first time a student participates, the student meets with their mentor in the weeks before a session starts to brainstorm project ideas and research directions. They start with as many as 10-15 ideas, narrow down to a handful that the student’s most interested in, and then dive in to brainstorm and identify a specific project for the quarter. Once a project is identified, a student works individually or in a small group to drive the research.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>COURSE GOALS:</span></strong> A first-time participant is expected to build a functioning prototype, conducting a small scale study (10-40 users), and write most of an academic paper (e.g., all sections with the exception of related work). A student continuing beyond a quarter will typically expand on their project by building a scalable, deployable system, conducting medium to large scale studies (100-1000+ users), and writing the entire research paper themselves. As students develop their design, technical, research, and communication skills, they are expected to mentor other DTR students, and to help others with both technical challenges and the research process.</p>"

            "Description": "<p>Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the design of systems that work for people and their organizations. HCI serves as the bridge between computing and humanity. The effective design of HCI systems requires a keen understanding of how interfaces and computer systems usefully support human endeavors (or not). Why would a particular set of characteristics of a system lead to reaching a desired outcome, while others encounter an obstacle? How might a good argument for a design be instantiated with effective interface and system models? Taking a step back, are our solutions actually addressing the underlying problem that humans face? What is actually the problem?</p>\r\n<p>We will, as a learning community, learn to ask and answer these questions for ourselves. One focus will be on developing our critical thinking and problem solving skills through team projects and studio critique, with special emphasis on learning more effective structures and representations for thinking about the design of HCI systems. Another focus will be on learning to soften into a deeper understanding of problems that people encounter than we might at first assume - that is, developing our capacities for humility, empathy, and curiosity. Last but not least, we focus on *doing* — agile sprints, rapid prototyping and testing, iterating — learning to face and embrace fears, imperfections, failures that may otherwise hold us back from moving forward. Through this we will learn to become more skillful in how we work on difficult problems.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>This course satisfies the CS Project Course & CS Breadth: Interfaces requirement.</em></li>\r\n<li><em><strong>Spring:</strong> Students will be required to attend two lectures (MW) and one lab (Th or F).</em><em><span class=\"_Tgc\"></span></em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIRED TEXTBOOK:</strong> None</p>\r\n<p><strong>REFERENCE TEXTBOOKS:</strong> None </p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE INSTRUCTOR:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/zhang-haoqi.html\">Prof. Haoqi Zhang</a></p>"

Computational photography combines ideas in computer vision, computer graphics, technical optics, and image processing. This course will first cover the fundamentals of image sensing and modern cameras.

Your coding must be correct, and your writeup must be clearly written (template will be provided) in order to receive a passing grade. For each assignment that you fail, your grade gets lowered by one letter. So if you pass all seven assignments you get an A, if you fail one assignment you get a B, if you fail two you get a C, and so on.

Creating visualizations is getting easier thanks to a proliferation of digital tools for transforming and visualizing data. Yet the best visualizations are still often creating by skilled human designers who have considerable experience with design analysis.</p>\r\n<p>In this course we will consider what it means for a visualization to be effective and what sorts of principles, techniques and algorithms from statistics, graphic design, databases, perceptual psychology, cognitive science and related fields can help us create effective visualizations. Though there are different uses of the term “visualization” in popular media, for the purposes of this class, we will treat information visualization as the use of interactive interfaces to visually represent abstract data. The course is targeted both towards students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students interested in building better visualization tools and systems.  In addition to participating in class discussions, students will demonstrate their learning through weekly short quizzes and several assignments requiring visualization design, exploratory data analysis, and interactive visualization implementation.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to being comfortable programming, students should have a basic working knowledge of, or willingness to learn, a graphics API. We we will cover introductory D3 in class to get you started, but this is not a JavaScript or web development course. Students will be expected to self-study to learn JavaScript and other basic web technologies (HTML, CSS) if they are not familiar with them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><strong>Formerly COMP_SCI 396/496</strong>.</em></li>\r\n<li><strong><i>This course satisfies Interface breadth requirement.</i></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE COORDINATORS: </strong><a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hullman-jessica.html\"></a><a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hullman-jessica.html\">Prof. </a><a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hullman-jessica.html\">Jessica Hullman</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE INSTRUCTOR:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hullman-jessica.html\"></a><a href=\"mailto:jhullman@northwestern.edu#Prof.%20Hullman\">Prof. Hullman</a> (Fall), & <a href=\"mailto:mjskay@northwestern.edu\">Prof. Kay</a> (Winter)</p>"

Such processing units routinely come with hundreds to thousands of cores per chip and sell for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. The massive parallelism they offer allows applications to run 2x-450x faster than on conventional multicores. However, to reach this performance improvement, the application must fully utilize the computational, storage and communication resources provided by the device. This course discusses state-of-the-art parallel programming optimization methods to achieve this goal.</p>\r\n<p>Ideally this course will bring together people with strong programming skills, with people with a strong need for solving compute-intensive problems that can benefit from programming graphics processors. The initial part of the course will discuss a popular programming interface for graphics processors, the CUDA programming tools for NVIDIA processors. The course will continue with a closer view of the internal architecture of graphics processors and how it impacts performance. Finally, implementations of applications and algorithms on graphics processors will be discussed.</p>\r\n<p>The course is lab intensive, and it will utilize the machines at the Wilkinson lab. Students taking the course for COMP_ENG/EECS-368 credit will work on labs that utilize advanced parallel programming, data layout, and algorithm decomposition concepts. Students taking the course for COMP_ENG/EECS-468 credit will work on the same labs and also a quarter-long open-ended final project that draws upon their own interests and line of research.

Each programming assignment will involve successively more sophisticated programming skills. The labs will be done in groups of two. The list below is tentative and subject to change:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Matrix multiplication. The lab’s focus is on producing correct code. This project reinforces the acquisition of basic GPU/CUDA programming skills, the software interface, and the basic architecture of the device.</li>\r\n<li>Tiled matrix multiplication. This lab focuses on data layout and decomposition, and full utilization of shared memory resources and global bandwidth through bank conflict avoidance and memory coalescing.</li>\r\n<li>Histograms. In this lab you are called to define optimization goals and strategy, implement them, and keep a research lab journal on which you report statistics and analyze every optimization you tried, even ones that did not work or degraded performance.

The work will be a quarter-long open-ended final project that draws upon the students’ own interests and line of research. Ideally, in their final project the students will form interdisciplinary teams and complete the first steps of optimizing a real-world contemporary compute-intense problem in science or engineering (e.g., materials science, astrophysics, civil engineering, etc.). The students are expected to base their ideas on recent literature and their own line of research and needs. It is the students responsibility to propose a research project suitable for this class. The project selection requires the permission of the instructor. For this, there will be a project proposal phase. The final project will culminate to a paper report, and a presentation/demo held at the final few class meetings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </strong>When a student completes this course, s/he should be able to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(a) Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering (parallel programming techniques, kernel decomposition, synchronization, memory access optimizations, data layout transformations, branching/loop optimizations, algorithm cascading, Brent’s theorem, input diagonalization, FP representations, regularization, compaction, binning, thread coarsening).</li>\r\n<li>(b) Design and conduct experiments, analyze, and interpret data (design and conduct experiments on real massively parallel applications written using CUDA, utilize industrial tools to identify and overcome performance bottlenecks, measure execution time and speedup on GPU devices).</li>\r\n<li>(c) Design a software system to meet desired needs within realistic constraints (design optimized massively parallel programs for GPUs by amplifying the utilization of constrained resources including PCIe bandwidth, global memory bandwidth, shared memory banks, texture and constant memory, warps, thread blocks, SMP registers, etc.).</li>\r\n<li>(d) Ability to function on multidisciplinary teams (the collaborative term projects will ideally pair together computer scientists and engineers with domain experts).</li>\r\n<li>(e) Ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems using industry-strength CUDA tools.</li>\r\n<li>(g) Ability to communicate effectively (research papers and reports, presentations, posters).</li>\r\n<li>(i) Recognize the need for, and have the ability to engage in life-long learning (read recent research papers in an unfamiliar subject and assimilate knowledge without direct supervision).</li>\r\n<li>(j) Gain knowledge of contemporary issues (state-of-the-art in GPU programming, energy-efficiency in computer architectures, high-performance parallel programming, heterogeneous computing).</li>\r\n<li>(k) Ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice (GPUs, CUDA, occupancy calculator, Ocelot, OpenCL, parallel programming techniques).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>TENTATIVE SCHEDULE</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Introduction to GPUs and their Programming Model.

            "Description": "<p>Story games (or storygames) are narrative frameworks in which participants (players) collaborate with each other and with the system to tell stories they find compelling.  Examples include story-centric computer role-playing games such as <em>Disco Elysium</em>, but also larp and story-centric tabletop role playing games such as those based on the Fate, PBtA, GUMSHOE, and DramaSystem systems, as well as smaller, more personal games of the lyric games movement.</p>\r\n<p>In this course we will study, play and design story games, study and build AI-based story-generation systems, and experiment with the use of AI systems in story games.  No previous programming knowledge is necessary for the 295 section.  The 396 section will go more deeply into the formal and algorithmic foundations of these technologies.</p>\r\n<p>AI assignments will use two experimental AI systems, <em>Step</em>, and <em>Imaginarium</em>, designed to be accessible to non-programmers.  295 students will use these systems as tools to make stories and story artifacts.  396 students will additionally learn their detailed semantics and structure. </p>\r\n<h3>Grading</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Individual assignments: 50% (AI assignments, weekly feedback from your group)</li>\r\n<li>Group assignments: 50% (game designs, weekly gameplay reports)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Reasons not to take this course</h3>\r\n<p>This class is not for everyone.  One issue is that we really will play story games in class.  These games involve acting, and effectively, fiction writing.  If these things will make you feel exposed and uncomfortable, that’s okay, but you might not enjoy the course.  That said, you will never be graded on your acting ability or artistry, only on whether you showed up prepared for your games and you made an honest effort.</p>\r\n<p>This is not intended to be a conceptually difficult course.  But it will be a time-intensive course, since it will involve not only programming, but playing games, reading games, and watching videos of games being played.  Students should expect to spend 10 hours a week on outside activities (gameplay, assigned readings and videos, game design, and working with the AI tools, guest speakers).</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we will be playing improvisational games that emphasize character and story, not combat-oriented RPGs like <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> that make less contact with the AI and narrative issues we want to explore.  So if you’re drawn to RPGs for combat, leveling up, min-maxing, etc., you may be disappointed by the course.</p>\r\n<h3>Thematic content and trigger warnings</h3>\r\n<p>These games tell stories; they’re a form of literature or theatre.  As such, they address the same wide range of themes as traditional literature and theatre.  While we will avoid playing games likely to produce emotional distress, we will discuss a wide range of games.  Some of these games may address difficult issues such as race, gender, ethnic conflict, poverty, anti-capitalism, religion, sexuality, disability, illness, mortality, suicide, and mental health.</p>\r\n<p>Many games involve explicit depictions or simulations of violence.  Although, we will not play games that mandate graphic depictions of violence, many of the games we discuss will have some notion of combat.  Some games seek to raise awareness of intimate partner violence, child abuse, or sexual assault, although we will not play them.</p>\r\n<p>Horror has been an especially important genre in the historical development of narrative games.  These include games involving threats from monsters, but also cosmic/existential horror.  As with any horror literature, they can also involve themes or events deliberately chosen for their disturbing nature: serial killing, war crimes, child abuse, etc.  These games also often represent mental illness, usually in ways chosen for dramatic effect more than clinical accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, contemporary game design is often critically and politically engaged.  At least three different games we will mention touch on the issues of access to health care within the US.  One of the collections we will discuss is named <a href=\"http://storytelling.pelgranepress.com/feminism-a-nano-game-anthology/\"><em>#feminism</em></a>.  Some of the games we will discuss are designed by members LGBTQIA+ community and engage issues of queer experience, be it contemporary, historical or fantastical.</p>\r\n<p>Again, we will not play games in class that are likely to produce emotional distress.  In the event of unanticipated emotional distress, any student may bow out of any game at any time.  That said, if any of the content discussed above is problematic for you, you might prefer to avoid the course.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE COORDINATOR: <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/horswill-ian.html\" target=\"_self\">Prof. Ian Horswil</a><br/>COURSE INSTRUCTOR: <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/horswill-ian.html\" target=\"_self\">Prof. Ian Horswil</a></strong></p>"

            "Description": "<p>Computing technologies shape our personal, social, and political lives in increasingly complex and consequential ways – providing tremendous benefits (e.g. convenient access to information, connecting to one another across time and space) and harms (e.g. biased decision-making, mass surveillance, disinformation campaigns, and exclusion from critical material opportunities) that are important to examine and understand. </p>\r\n<p>At the same time, these technologies are born and shaped by the societies in which they are developed. Thus, grappling with the ethics of technologies (i.e considering the harms and benefits, how and why they were created in the first place, and how and to what ends they are used) is important not only for ultimately creating more moral technologies but a more moral society. Thus, our approach to the ethics of computing technologies requires a multifaceted assessment of their harm and benefit to our individual, cultural, and political lives, and simultaneously a critical examination of the values, ideologies, and contexts through which computing technologies emerge. </p>\r\n<p>To accomplish this, we will engage in critical reading and synthesizing across a range of topics drawn from computer science and HCI, education and learning sciences, as well as ethics and philosophy. We will also engage in hands-on activities to help us consider how technical decisions (e.g. sampling, data collection practices, categorization and classification, prediction, system design, etc.) involve human judgements that can have both intended and unintended consequences. Specifically, students will:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Examine the design choices and tradeoffs that various computing infrastructures make (and have made) in relation to important societal values (e.g. individual autonomy, free speech, equity, privacy, justice, security, access to opportunity, etc.).</li>\r\n<li>Consider some of the intended and unintended consequences of computing applications within our communities, institutions, and social systems (e.g. schooling, employment, policing, transportation, business, etc.). This involves paying attention to who wins and who loses, as well as how these technologies might amplify existing marginalities and privileges.</li>\r\n<li>Develop a variety of analytic lenses for examining computing technologies in terms of their social, ethical, and political consequences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The course is open to all students. For CS majors and minors, the course aims to help students to consider and grapple with ethical dimensions of their work, in order to inform a more critical technical practice. For students pursuing non-computing disciplines, the course aims to provide a solid foundation for thinking about the possibilities, risks, and impacts of computer-mediated infrastructures on society.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>course format</strong> will consist of:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Readings and in-class discussions of current and enduring socio-technical dilemmas, and how they relate to applications of AI, Big Data, and the Internet.</li>\r\n<li>Hands-on activities to help students to consider the potential impacts of different kinds of technical decisions (e.g. sampling, data collection practices, categorization and classification strategies, prediction, system design, etc.).</li>\r\n<li>Reflective writing assignments that will ask you to analyze the social and ethical dimensions of contemporary technology debates.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>To <strong>apply</strong>, please fill out the Fall 2021 Application: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/NZYYf8fE5u1eRJB28\"></a><a href=\"https://forms.gle/NZYYf8fE5u1eRJB28\">https://forms.gle/NZYYf8fE5u1eRJB28</a><a href=\"https://forms.gle/NZYYf8fE5u1eRJB28\"></a></p>\r\n<p>There will be<strong> no pre-registration</strong> for this course, but anyone who fills out this form will be kept up to date, via email, of where they are on the waiting list.

            "Description": "<p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) serves as the bridge between computing and humanity. The effective design of HCI systems requires a keen understanding of how interfaces and computer systems usefully support human endeavors (or not). Why would a particular set of characteristics of a system lead to reaching a desired outcome, while others encounter an obstacle? How might a good argument for a design be instantiated with effective interface and system models? Taking a step back, are our solutions actually addressing the underlying problem that humans face? What is actually the problem?<br/> <br/> Through the studio method, we will, as a learning community, learn to ask and answer these questions for ourselves. One focus will be on developing our critical thinking and problem solving skills through team projects and studio critique, with special emphasis on learning more effective structures and representations for thinking about the design of HCI systems. Another focus will be on learning to soften into a deeper understanding of problems that people encounter than we might at first assume - that is, developing our capacities for humility, empathy, and curiosity. Last but not least, we focus on *doing* — agile sprints, rapid prototyping and testing, iterating — learning to face and embrace fears, imperfections, failures that may otherwise hold us back from moving forward. Through this we will learn to become more skillful in how we work on difficult problems.<br/> <br/> REQUIREMENTS FOR ENROLLING, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:<br/> While the course has no formal pre-requisites, learning via a studio method demands that students are open to constructive feedback and critique from the instructor, TAs, and/or peers. It also demands a willingness to learn together, as a community.<br/> <br/> Given the course’s ambitious learning objectives—both in the subject area and more generally in how we approach difficult problems—students taking the course should have a strong willingness in learning and growing personally. The course will demand a significant amount of self-direction: students need to be able and willing to learn on their own and in groups through their own volition, and in doing so, still thoughtfully approach challenges new, unfamiliar, and (potentially) uncomfortable ways. In other words, the course is meant for students who are serious about learning how to design computing systems for human use, *and* of ways to work with themselves and teammates through challenges.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>This course satisfies the project requirement or Technical Elective.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE COORDINATORS: </strong><span class=\"mail_link\"><a href=\"mailto:maia.jacobs@northwestern.edu\">Prof. Maia Jacobs</a></span><strong><br/></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE INSTRUCTOR: </strong><span class=\"mail_link\"><a href=\"mailto:maia.jacobs@northwestern.edu\">Prof. Maia Jacobs</a></span></p>"

Over the last few decades, networked systems have become an integrated part of everyday life and a critical piece of our economic, educational, health and defense systems. This fact is normally brought up as evidence of the success and broader impact of our field of work.</p>\r\n<p>The other, typically avoided, side of the story is the complications that this translates into for experimentalists. Today it is virtually impossible to run a randomized controlled experiment at even fractions of the scale of many of our systems. Despite this, as we explore new ideas in these uncharted territories we are reasonably asked to provide better evidence of the effects of interventions. In this seminar we will discuss ongoing projects on networked systems experimentation and their applications, in wired and wireless settings, that address some of these challenges.</p>\r\n<p>The class consists of two major components: reading and reviewing papers and doing a research project on your own. For the research part of the course, you will have the chance to work (and expand) some existing platforms and datasets as you formulate and try to answer these and other interesting questions of Internet scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://oldaqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/classes/eecs-395-ISE\">http://oldaqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/classes/eecs-395-ISE</a><a href=\"http://www.aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/classes/eecs-395-ISE\"></a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE TOPICS:</strong></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Introductory notes: Internet architecture, practical issues and good practices for Internet-scale experimentation</li>\r\n<li>Experimental platforms: Experimental design, context of experiments</li>\r\n<li>Experimental design</li>\r\n<li>End-to-end and up-the-stack</li>\r\n<li>Network infrastructure</li>\r\n<li>Traffic</li>\r\n<li>Applications and distributed services: DNS, Web, P2P, VoD, OSN, ..</li>\r\n<li>Botnets and other maladies</li>\r\n<li>Security and ethical issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>PREREQUISITES:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"340.html\">COMP_SCI 340 \"Intro to Computer Networking\"</a> or <a href=\"345.html\">COMP_SCI 345 \"Distributed Systems\"</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If you have taken similar courses somewhere else or have not taken any of these courses, but would like to register for this seminar, please contact <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/bustamante-fabian.html\"><strong>Prof. Fabián E Bustamante</strong></a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE ORGANIZATION:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The course is organized as a series of paper discussions and a single term-long project.</p>\r\n<p>Most class meetings will be centered around one or two paper presentations and discussion. You should read each paper <em>before</em> coming to class and be prepared to discuss it.</p>\r\n<p>The class will run as mini-conference with <strong>you</strong> as the Program Committee member. We will use the papers included in the schedule as our set of submissions. Each of you will write reviews for 3-4 of them. We will discuss the papers in a two-part PC meeting (around midterm and the end of the quarter) to decide what paper \"should be accepted\" for publication.</p>\r\n<p><strong>READING PAPERS AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>We will read between 2-4 papers per week. The papers will be first presented to the group by one or more students and then discussed in a round-table manner.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure lively discussions, you will be responsible for reading the assigned papers before each class. <strong>I will post a question about each paper 24hr before class.</strong> Your answer need only be long enough to demonstrate that you understand the paper; a paragraph or two should be enough. I will check your answers to make sure they make sense and they will count for part of the paper discussion grade.</p>\r\n<p>You may find the following documents useful:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><a href=\"http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf\"><strong>How to Read a Paper</strong></a> by S.

There are some good <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.htm\"><strong>pointers</strong></a> around that you may want to look at.</p>\r\n<p>Here is an incomplete list of dos and don'ts:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Don't try to present the whole work; remember the talk is just a taster.</li>\r\n<li>Think of your primary audience to decide what/what not to expand on.</li>\r\n<li>Use examples to motivate the work and approach, and illustrate the key points.</li>\r\n<li>Don't put too much on a slide - prune and then prune again.</li>\r\n<li>Don't put too much on a slide - just one figure/graph per slide!</li>\r\n<li>Don't put too much on a slide - don't waste the header/slide title!</li>\r\n<li>Careful with use of animation - not for show, just for clarity</li>\r\n<li>Please put numbers in your slides</li>\r\n<li>Seriously consider dropping the typical \"overview/roadmap\" slide</li>\r\n<li>Saying enough without saying too much - enough depth to convey your ideas, not so much as to overwhelm your audience</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>PROJECTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>There will be one single project on which you will work throughout the quarter - this is a critical component of the course. Your goal is to propose and tackle a research problem that requires the use of (or explores challenges with) Internet-scale experimentation.</p>\r\n<p>Project reports must be written up in a term paper (due during finals week) and teams will present a summary of their findings at the end of the course as part of a systems class mini-conference. Projects ideas will be suggested by the instructor, but you are strongly encouraged to come up with your own ideas. Based on the topic of your project, you will be assigned a project leader to help you through the quarter.</p>\r\n<p>This is the schedule of meetings and deliverables (mainly to ensure steady progress):</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Form a group: <em>First week of classes.</em></li>\r\n<li>Project meeting with instructor: <em>Second week of classes.</em></li>\r\n<li>Project initial presentation (you should read the <a href=\"http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ssp/papers/HPL-CSP-90-42.pdf\"><strong>CSP project startup</strong></a> or look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier#Heilmeier.27s_Catechism\"><strong>Questions that any project proposal should answer -- the Heilmeier \"Catechism\"</strong></a>). The presentation should be 4 slides long, including (1) Project name and team members, (2) What are the research contributions of the project? List of new/interesting concepts to be investigated, (3) Why do we care if you are successful?, and (4) Project milestones and schedule for the rest of the quarter: <em> Third week of classes.</em></li>\r\n<li>Midterm presentation and report. The presentation should be 4 slides long, including (1) Project name and team members, (2) Revised statement of project goals and list of new/interesting concepts to be investigated, (3) List of issues addressed and pending, and (4) Updated project milestones, highlighting accomplishments to date, and schedule for the rest of the quarter: <em>Fourth/Fifth week of classes.</em></li>\r\n<li>Project meeting with instructor: <em>Ninth week of classes.</em></li>\r\n<li>Final presentation: <em>Finals week</em>.</li>\r\n<li>Final report due: <em>During finals week.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The final report has to conform to the format used by the <a href=\"http://www.sigcomm.org/events/hotnets-workshop\"><strong>Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks</strong></a>. Reports should be no longer than 6 pages (you can use appendices or a webpage to document details). The following structure is suggested:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Abstract: <em>What did you do, why is important and what are your high-level results?</em></li>\r\n<li>Problem statement: <em>What is the problem you tried to solve?</em></li>\r\n<li>Prior work: <em>How others have addressed the problem before and why that was not enough?</em></li>\r\n<li>Research approach: <em>What was your approach to solving the problem? What did you design, build? What was your experimental methodology?</em></li>\r\n<li>Results: <em>What were your results? How did you evaluate your work? What were your figures of merit?</em></li>\r\n<li>Lessons learned and future work: <em>If you knew what you know now, what would you do differently? What questions are left for future work?</em></li>\r\n<li>Summary and conclusions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>GRADES:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In use, will be a criterion-referenced method to assign your grade; in other words, your grade will be based on how well you do relative to predetermined performance levels, instead of in comparison with the rest of the class. Thus, if a test has 100 possible points, anyone with a score of 90 or greater will get an A, those with scores of 80 or greater will get a B, those with scores of 70 or greater will get a C, and so on. Total scores (between 0 and 100) will be determined, roughly, as follows:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Paper discussion participation (and questions) 10%</li>\r\n<li>Paper review and PC meeting participation 20%</li>\r\n<li>Paper presentation 20%</li>\r\n<li>Project 50%</li>\r\n</ul>"

A key part of the class will be to review and discuss networking research papers. Students must read the assigned papers and submit paper reviews before each lecture. Two teams of students will be chosen to debate and lead the discussion. One team will be designated the offense and the other the defense. In class, the defense team will present first. For 30 minutes the team will discuss the work as if it were their own. </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The team should present the work and make a compelling case why the contribution is significant. This will include the context of the contribution, prior work, and in cases where papers are previously published, how the work has influenced the research community or industry's directions (impact). If the paper is very recent, the defense should present arguments for the potential impact. Coming up with potential future work can show how the paper opens doors to new</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li>The presentation should go well beyond a paper \"summary\". The defense should not critique the work other than to try to pre-empt attacks from the offense (e.g., by explicitly limiting the scope of the contribution).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li>The defense should also try to look up related work to support their case (CiteSeer is a good place to start looking.)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>After the defense presentation, the offense team will state their case for 20 minutes. </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>This team should critique the work, and make a case for missing links, unaddressed issues, lack of impact, inappropriateness of the problem formulation,</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li>The more insightful and less obvious the criticisms the better.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li>While the offense should prepare remarks in advance, they should also react to the points made by the defense.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li>The offense should also try to look up related work to support their case.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Next, the defense and offense will be allowed follow up arguments, and finally, the class will question either side either for clarifications or to add to the discussions and controversy and make their own points on either side. The presentations should be written in Powerpoint format and will be posted on the course web page after each class. </p>\r\n<h3>Writing and Submitting Reviews </h3>\r\n<p>All students must read the assigned papers and write reviews for the papers before each lecture. Email the reviews to the instructor (akuzma@cs.northwestern.edu) prior to each lecture and the reviews will be posted on the course web page. Periodically, the instructor will evaluate a random subset of the reviews and provide feedback and grades to students. </p>\r\n<p>Please send one review in plain text per email in the body of the email message. </p>\r\n<p>A review should summarize the paper sufficiently to demonstrate your understanding, should point out the paper's contributions, strengths as well as weaknesses. Think in terms of what makes good research? What qualities make a good paper? What are the potential future impacts of the work? Note that there is no right or wrong answer to these questions. A review's quality will mainly depend on its thoughtfulness. Restating the abstract/conclusion of the paper will not earn a top grade. Reviews are roughly half-page and should cover all of the following aspects: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>What is the main result of the paper? (One or two sentence summary)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li>What strengths do you see in this paper?

This course focuses on the legal, business, technical, teamwork, design, presentation, and other skills involved in that process. Students will work as part of a multidisciplinary team to explore a problem relating to the legal profession, understand the stakeholders' needs, brainstorm, prototype, and test ideas, and iterate through the develop.</p>\r\n<p>Our process combines user and audience research, design thinking, critical and analytical work, iterative building, storytelling, new technology, and a healthy dose of experimentation--often within the confines of a single, specific problem. </p>\r\n<p>Each quarter, we create multidisciplinary teams of Northwestern students, faculty, and professionals to collaborate on projects we believe are important for the future of media. That could mean everything from making obscure data more available to journalists to solving questions around how to best navigate space in virtual reality. The Lab places students at the center of these important problems for 10 weeks. We work together to identify problems and to find solutions.   </p>\r\n<p>The class is a team-based, cooperative lab experience for students who want to create and explore new tools, stories, story forms, and physical devices. We expect students to spend at least six hours a week on the project outside of class, preferably with their team.   </p>\r\n<p>Students are at the center of each project, determining the best roadmap based on research, creative work, and iterative design based on user testing and interviews. Each project we're tackling this quarter, then, has its own set of milestones, some of which will be generated by the students. Final project will also vary in nature, but each final presentation will include a demo, supporting materials (a Github repository, prototypes, and/or technical documentation, depending on the group. Whenever possible the Lab tries to work in the open—we're open-sourcing not only our code, but the thought process behind our work.<br/> <br/> The Lab is designed to facilitate collaboration, productivity, and project-driven learning. We follow an agile development process that includes design-based research, scrum, structured critiques, pair research and programming, and code review.   </p>\r\n<p>All students will work in teams with responsibility shared among members. In particular, students work in cross-functional teams. Our expectation is that all team members will participate in the framing, architecture and implementation of projects. </p>\r\n<p>When a group presents to the larger class, students are expected to explain what they did, why they did it, and how it addresses the user needs identified by the team. Students are not required to put together a slide deck, but structured presentations are a must. Our meetings will move quickly, so we aim to make the most of our time together. All team members must present at least twice during the quarter.   </p>\r\nAt the end of the quarter, students will present a working prototype or researching findings, as well as a companion piece that details their process along the way. <br/>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><strong>This course fulfills the Technical Elective & Project Course requirement.</strong></em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE INSTRUCTOR: </strong><a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hammond-kristian.html\" target=\"_self\">Prof. Kristian Hammond</a> & <a href=\"mailto:daniel.linna@law.northwestern.edu\">Prof. Daniel W.

            "Description": "<p>The development of low-level software such as drivers, kernels, hypervisors, run-times, system libraries, JITs, and firmware is very different from the development of applications. The goal of this class is to teach students how such development is done, both in terms of the modes of thinking needed to design, implement, debug, and optimize low-level software, and in terms of how to leverage representative, widely-used tools to do so. Some of the techniques the class covers are also used in the design and optimization of the performance-critical parts of applications. </p>\r\n<p>Each student will apply what they are learning  to an individual or small group low-level software development project. Ideally, each student would come to the class with their own low-level software development task in mind.</p>\r\n<p>The general environment we will consider is the Linux kernel on 64-bit x86 using the GCC and related compiler toolchains and tools. Other environments may include a custom kernel, a hypervisor, and firmware. Projects in the class can involve other platforms. The student will see:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Features of the C language and special features of most C compilers that are designed to facilitate mapping of hardware interfaces to software constructs:  bitfields, unions, forced alignment, packing, atomic and synchronization primitives,  calling conventions, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Techniques to take complete control over the machine when necessary, or to build constructs that are not simple functions or data structures: inline assembly, separate assembly, self-modifying code, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Important attributes of code and data, such as position independence, relocatability, symbol/section inclusion, embedding, loaders, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Custom linking to build images that are not simple executables: linker scripts, ELF, static and dynamic linking (especially within a kernel).</li>\r\n<li>Hardware and related debugging methods: JTAG, SPI/I2C, PCI, QEMU, kgdb, scope, logic analyzer, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Debugging concurrency.</li>\r\n<li>The hardware environment: interrupts, concurrency, memory properties, state machines, the nature of hardware interfaces, hardware bugs, forced firmware (e.g. SMI), microcode, etc.</li>\r\n<li>The kernel environment in general: monolithic kernels, microkernels, hypervisors, executives,  APIs versus ABIs versus kernel-internal interfaces, system calls, libc, etc.</li>\r\n<li>An in-depth view of a specific kernel environment: Linux kernel, kernel modules, Kbuild, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Why and when to distrust the compiler and other tools, or the hardware.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>This course is intended for advanced CS and CE undergraduates and graduate students, particularly Ph.D.s. If you’re interested in this class, but not sure you have the background, please contact the instructor.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>For CS undergraduates, this course counts towards the Project requirement.

A project can be undertaken by a team whose size depends on the complexity of the project.

We will discuss some of the constraints that limit the design and programmability of modern processors, and promising techniques to mitigate these constraints. As such, we will draw material from seminal and recent publications in top computer architecture conferences and journals. By exposing the students to state-of-the-art research, the course serves as an entry point to further research in computer architecture. The course will cover a sample of research across a wide spectrum of topics from emerging architectures, including quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, space-time computing, silicon photonics in computer architectures, and advanced techniques in more traditional topics, including memory systems and advanced cache designs, memory consistency models and operational semantics, programmability (e.g., transactional memory, deterministic programming, speculative multithreading), on-chip interconnects, power/thermal management, reliability, and fault tolerance. The exact collection of topics varies across offerings, as the field itself evolves rapidly. The course has a seminar format, and the students are expected to lead multiple presentations throughout the quarter. The course requires the completion of a project in computer architecture. The project component of the course is open-ended, and students are encouraged to draw on their own research interests and prior background for inspiration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIRED TEXT:</strong> None; we'll draw material from seminal and recent publications in top conferences, as well as chapters from the Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture by Morgan & Claypool.</p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE COORDINATOR:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hardavellas-nikos.html\" target=\"_self\">Prof. Nikos Hardavellas</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>COURSE OBJECTIVES:</strong> The course aims to offer a firm background for research in computer architecture. The students that successfully complete the course will be exposed to a variety of cutting-edge research topics, be able to read and critique research publications in computer architecture, perform conference-quality paper reviews, perform research presentations, write research reports, and gain familiarity with state-of-the-art tools for research in computer architecture. Along with providing technical knowledge, the course also aims to develop the student's ethos as researchers and research referees, and sharpen the students team-participation skills.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GRADES:</strong> Grades are based on class presentations, project, homework assignments (if any), and class participation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EXAMS:</strong> There are no exams in this course.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ABET CONTENT: </strong>100% Engineering</p>"

Except the central P versus NP question, we explore a variety of other fascinating topics, including the connection between learning theory and average-case complexity, hardness versus randomness (the BPP versus P question), and the surprising equivalence of probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) and the hardness of approximating certain optimization problems. </p>\r\n<strong>INSTRUCTOR: <a href=\"mailto:xue.chen1@northwestern.edu\">Email Prof. Xue</a><br/> </strong>"
